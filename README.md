# DAT ASSESSMENT

- Completed using Next.js with Typescript and SCSS
- Completed the assessment without using any UI Libraries/CSS Framework.
- My dependencies ```package.json```:
```
"dependencies": {
    "next": "12.2.5",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "sass": "^1.54.4"
},
```

# HOW TO RUN

- Clone or download the repository.
- Start `Node.js` terminal inside project root folder.
- Run the following commands:
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

# PROJECT STRUCTURE

- I have broken down the whole page into multiple sections to ease development and review, they can be found under `sections` folder.
- The interfaces are present inside `interfaces` folder.
- I used SCSS for styling the project upon interviewer's request, I used mixins, variables, nesting and other SCSS features for creating stylesheets.
- The reusable components are present inside `components` folder.
- In order to reduce prop drilling (since proper state management e.g. Redux, Context API or MobX is not in the scope of this assessment) the `localStorage` logic is initialized inside `index.tsx`.

# TASKS OUTPUT

- I created separate branch for each task.
